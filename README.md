An anagram is a word that can be obtained by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the constituent letters exactly once. For example, the words "admirer" and "married" are anagrams of one another. However, the words "rather" and "harder" are not anagrams, since "rather" does not contain the letter 'd' and "harder" does not contain the letter 't'. Two identical words are anagrams, too. Anagram of any word must be of the same length as the word itself.

Function to find the minimum number of letters that is needed to add to make the given words anagrams.

For example, given the words "apple" and "pear", the function should return 3, since 'r' can be added to the first word and the 'p' and 'l' to the second word to form anagrams.

And for the given words "lemon" and "melon", the function should return 0, since the given words are already anagrams.
